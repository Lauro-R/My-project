This project was made to learn Unity's basic fundamentals and how to make a simple shoot 'em up game.

The code used in this involves the following:
RigidBody 2D uses, AddForce, Velocity and Transform
Setting up a Main Menu Scene with multiple screens in one Scene
Sound Controllers for the game sounds
Shmup game mechanics with particle systems and instanced projectiles
